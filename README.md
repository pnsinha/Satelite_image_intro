### Exploring Geospatial Raster Images
#### RCC Workshop Series
 
Abstract: Raster images are the data captured by satellites orbiting the Earth. Raster images can be far more challenging to find and process, but their high level of detail and frequent updates make them incredibly valuable for analysis. The recent development in computing and remote sensing techniques have contributed to the explosive growth in the different raster products. This workshop will focus on the basics of raster processing and explore different types of raster products such as light at night (VIIRS), global human settlement and footprints layers, and different building footprint products.

Objectives: Students will be able to:
1)	Understand the basics of different raster products
2)	Basic understanding of remote sensing and sensors
3)	Find the raster products and extract processes from them
4)	Perform basic operations and analysis using R
